# Content I Like

I've always found it fascinating to discover what inspires and shapes others' perspectives. While book recommendations are common, I believe meaningful content comes in many forms. This collection represents media across various formats that have left a lasting impression on me, expanded my thinking, or provided unique insights I continue to carry.

The items highlighted in red hold special significanceâ€”works that fundamentally shifted my worldview and to which I find myself returning again and again, discovering new layers with each revisit.
