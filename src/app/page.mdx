With 5+ years of experience across **technical product development, startup acceleration, and ecosystem building**, I’ve helped 100+ founders across East Africa move from idea to market, building real products, acquiring customers, and growing revenue.

Currently at **[StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/)**, I lead programs that turn ideas into scalable businesses by working closely with universities, innovation hubs, and ecosystem partners. My past work includes designing and building software products, training young women in STEM under the UN Women’s African Girls Can Code Initiative and building logistics and geospatial data tools for infrastructure development, equipping me with a solid foundation in creating solutions that solve real-world problems.

**What I’m Currently Building:** a new class of Advertising Technology (AdTech) solutions that empower African agencies to:
- Boost campaign efficiency
- Reduce budget waste and maximize ROI
- Unlock new possibilities in programmatic advertising

I’m passionate about enabling real progress through products, people, and platforms. If you're working on something exciting in AdTech, Venture Building, or Product Strategy in African markets, **let's connect** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnie-lutaro-b73240aa/), or reach out via [E-mail](mailto:ronnielutaro@outlook.com) for business inquiries.

Each essay or blog post is written with just enough to deliver valuable ideas without overwhelming the reader. Read
